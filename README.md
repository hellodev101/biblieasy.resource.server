##Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This project uses external library called (JCE) Java Cryptography Extension. I use this library to secure my properties file, so that I can use {cipher} to encrypt all the sensitive information.
If you use OpenJDK11 you can skip this step. JDK 9 and later offer the stronger cryptographic algorithms by default. 
Otherwise, you can download in the link below, or you can find it in the project file.

* [JCE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jce-all-downloads.html)


#### Installing:  
1. You basically need to do is navigate to your JDK installation path 
2. place local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar under jre/lib/security.
3. Copy and paste C:\Program Files\jdkx.xx.\jre\lib\security direction to both Path
    User variables and System variables
   

### How does it work?
```aidl
POST http://localhost:8080/encrypt
```

Body: RAW, text

write down the password you want to encrypt.

### decrypte:

```aidl
POST http://localhost:8080/decrypt
```

Body: RAW, text

paste the encrypted password you got from encrypt result.

### Running the test

Once start the application, the data will be added automatically. The testing data is in the main application or Application.java 

## Important
Every user has roles, and depending on role, he can only read(get), delete, update(put), or write(post).
And every testing the authorization is required.

### How to authorize work in postman?

There are two ways to authorize yourself by using Headers or Authorization tab.
####Headers: 

KEY: `Authorization`
